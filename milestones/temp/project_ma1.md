# Team Project Micro Assignment #1

## Description
For pursuing every team members participate in, I would like give you all some micro assignments to learn basic skills relete with software engineering. 

The first task is setting repository in your local machine! We already have team project repo in Gitlab right? So, let's remote the repo to your local machine.

## Instructions
1. install `git` on your local machine, create new repository in your own workspace.
    ```
    C:User\<urname>>git --version
    git version 2.24.1.windows.2

    C:User\[name]>mkdir workspace

    C:User\[name]>cd workspace

    C:User\[name]\workspace>git clone git@gitlab.eecs.wsu.edu:43689/cgm-gymtracker.git

    ...
    ...

    C:User\[name]\workspace>cd cgm-gymtracker

    C:User\[name]\workspace\cgm-gymtracker>git status
    ...
    ...

    ```
    
2. Open `VisualStudio Code` and type your WSU ID in the correct place.
    ```
    C:User\[name]\workspace\cgm-gymtracker>code .
    ```
    Type your infomation between the pipelines (| |)
    ```
    ## Team Infomation
    | WSU ID | Names | EECS ID |
    |:-----|:--------|:---------|
    | |Madison Jane Holcomb | |
    | |Kadupitige Ashi Chamarasinghe | |
    | |Sydney Erin Gormley | |
    | |Navroop Kaur | |
    | |Sonam Yangtso | |
    |11701083 |Jongyun Kim |jkim4 |
    ```
    and save `README.md` file

3. Now, go back your terminal, do git commit with proper message.
    ```
    C:User\[name]\workspace\cgm-gymtracker>git status
    ...
    C:User\[name]\workspace\cgm-gymtracker>git add -A
    ...
    C:User\[name]\workspace\cgm-gymtracker>git commit -m "Edited team information in README.md"
    ...
    C:User\[name]\workspace\cgm-gymtracker>git push
    ...
    ```

4. Send a message in the "Teams" to notice to everyone what I did in repository :)
